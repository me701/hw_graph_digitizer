# An Exercise in Graph Digitization

In class, we explored three, distinct applications
that used 2-D graphics:

  - the embedded graph (with spreadsheet, etc.)
  - the (hard-coded) straight path to Mordor
  - the (hand-drawn) not-so-straight path to Mordor

Together, these three pieces can be used to develop a graph
(or plot) digitizer.

Your task is to deliver a PyQt application that
does the following:

  - allows a user to select and load an image (e.g., PNG) file that contains
    a typical "x-y" graph
  - allows a user to define a scale for each axis by selecting two points
    along each axis
  - allows a user to select one or more points on the image to capture
    the data shown on the underlying graph
  - stores the points the user selects and displays them in a `QTable` widget (i.e., a 
    spread sheet)
  - allows the user to save the selected points

You may use any of the code developed in class to complete this assignment.  
Refer to the the class notes and exercises for additional resources, including
an example PNG file and a link to an online tool that implements the 
features requested above.
